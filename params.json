It is not intended to be used in production environment, however,\r\nit may work. Use at your own discretion. Due to the nature of the motivation\r\nfor writing this library it is at times arguably over-complicated and against\r\nYAGNI principle. No Python Zen monks were actually harmed in the process.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom gwaith import get_rates\r\n\r\nfor rates in get_rates():\r\n    print(rates)\r\n\r\n# or\r\nonly = ('PLN', 'GBP')\r\nfor data in get_rates(processor=processors.to_json, only=only):\r\n    print(data)\r\n\r\n# or see bin/hand_test_lib_main.py for usage examples\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Processors\r\n\r\nTiny functions allowing you to return the data in some common formats. Feel\r\nfree to write your own. Have a look at `gwaith.processors` to understand the\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n:exclamation: The `processors` [extra](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies) installs dependencies needed by the\r\n`raw_python` processor, only install if you plan to use this processor. This is\r\n to limit number of dependencies (by half :metal:).\r\n\r\n## In production\r\n\r\nFrom GitHub only, there are no plans to release it to PyPi.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install git+ssh://git@github.com/bartekbrak/gwaith.git\r\npip install git+ssh://git@github.com/bartekbrak/gwaith.git#egg=gwaith[processors]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## For development\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:bartekbrak/gwaith.git\r\ncd gwaith\r\npip install -e . -r dev_requirements.txt\r\npip install -e[processors] . -r dev_requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Run tests\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install -r dev_requirements.txt\r\npy.test\r\n# run tests connecting to the Internet\r\npy.test -m 'online'\r\n# also have a look in setup.cfg to learn the hardcoded py.test args\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Known issues:\r\nThe library makes a few assumtions about the data that ECB provides\r\nthat might not hold and would require extra live testing:\r\n\r\n- Currency feeds provide rates on distinct dates, if this\r\n  breaks and two identical dates are provided, the earlier will be forgotten\r\n- The CSV processor creates a generator, this for the sake of the API cosistency\r\n  but this processor does not return anything, it writes directly to the object\r\n  provided, be it stdout or file, this might be surprising to the end user\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nI do not plan to expand the library, so fork the code and treat as your own.\r\n\r\n# Code structore\r\n`gwaith` contains the library, `bin` convenience shell scripts.\r\n\r\n# Licence\r\n\r\nReleased under MIT License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
